# FYS3150
Repo for the entirety of the course. We are a group of four working together in this project-based course.

# The projects are in seperate folders

Separated in code folder and tex folder.
Each project folder contains a README on how to compile and run the programs. The codes will usually be in a separate 'code'-folder, you should have been redirected directly to that folder from the pdf handed in. If that's not the case then the code will be in each project folder's respective "Code" folder.

## Code

Contains all need to run the codes made for the respective projects. There is a README in each of these folders explain the order in which to compile and run the different programs to get the desired output. We also include the command line promps, note that some will be for MacOS and some for a Linux OS (we use Ubuntu 20.04.1), this will of course be specified in the corresponding README. 

## Report

contains .tex file of the report. This is just to keep it seperate from the Code folder, this folder might contain plots and so on to correctly compile the .tex file. If it doesn't you can send us a message or plot the plots yourself through the codes provided :)
